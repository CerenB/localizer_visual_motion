## Installing dependencies

All the dependencies needed to run this are listed in the [mpm-requirements.txt file](.mpm-requirements.txt). If those functions are not in the matlab path the scripts in this repository will not work.

If you are using the [matlab package manager](https://github.com/mobeets/mpm), you can simply download the appropriate version of those dependencies and add them to your path by running the `getDependencies` function.

```matlab
getDependencies('update')
```

If you only already have the appropriate version but just want to add them to the matlab path, then run.

```matlab
getDependencies()
```
